Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand is an amazing book that shows the persistence and willpower needed for human survival. The main theme of Unbroken is resilience, the incredible resilience of the human spirit in the face of extreme, dehumanizing, and unrelenting adversity. The book tells the story of Louie Zamperini, an Olympian who is drafted into the military during World War II. After surviving a plane crash, he endures a harrowing experience adrift at sea before becoming a prisoner of war. 
Following the war, Louie struggles with PTSD and turns to alcohol as a coping mechanism. Eventually, he finds healing by joining a Christian church, which helps him overcome his mental scars from the war. 
This book really shows how awful war is and how much human dignity was taken from POWs during the war. In the book, Louie states how dignity is just as essential a human need as food and water, “Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. 
The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man's soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it” (Hillenbrand 182). 
This book is worth reading because it tells an incredible story that highlights the horrors of war and the beauty of human resilience.
